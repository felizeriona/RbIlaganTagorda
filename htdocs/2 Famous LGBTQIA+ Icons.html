        <h4>Bretman Rock</h4>
        <p> Bretman Rock Sacayanan Laforga is a gay Filipino beauty influencer, his most successful accounts being on Youtube and Instagram. One of the few men in the beauty industry, he is an Ilocano born in the Philippines but moved to Hawaii as a child, where he is now based. Known for his flamboyant personality and sense of humor, he became famous when one of his makeup contour videos went viral. Despite his social media repertoire mainly consisting of makeup tutorials and vlogs featuring his humorous life views, the influencer has also long been considered an icon of the LGBTQIA+ community. His confidence in being who he is and not hiding his sexuality for any reason serves as an inspiration, most especially to those in the community. </p>

        <img src="../images/Geraldine Roman.jpeg">
        <h4>Geraldine Roman</h4>
        <p> The Philippines’ first transgender congresswoman, Geraldine Roman is an advocate for LGBTQIA+ equality through her political projects. Elected as Representative of Bataan’s 1st District in 2016, she became chairperson of the House Committee on Women and Gender Equality in 2022. Furthermore, in the 18th Congress, she was one of those termed “equality champs” who pushed for the passing of the SOGIE equality bill, which would greatly impact LGBTQIA+ rights in a predominantly Catholic country. Together with the House Speaker, she filed the Civil Partnership Bill, a House Bill that would legalize even same-sex civil unions. </p>

      <div id="icon3">
        <img src="../images/Nora Aunor.jfif">
        <h4>Nora Aunor</h4>
        <p> Nora Aunor is a questioning bisexual multi-time award-nominated and awarded actress--a superstar. She was born in Iriga and grew up in Camarines Sur. Apart from her roles in acting, she also won the Darigold Jamboree and the Liberty Big Show--two major singing contests--in her younger years. She is crowned as one of the richest and most popular movie actresses in the Philippines. The actress admitted to romantically liking the star Vilma Santos, and even gifting her roses. She was thought to be lesbian by the public, but felt that the label wasn't for her. When asked if she is bisexual, she answered that she might fit that label.</p>

      <div id="icon4">
        <img src="../images/Marsha Johnson.jfif">
        <h4>Marsha P. Johnson</h4>
        <p> Marsha is a transgender African-American woman who is most known for being a predominant activist for LGBTQ rights. Unlike most "equality activists" at the time, Marsha was an advocate for queer people of color--who were usually left out of protests. She led the "Stonewall riot" in 1969 after police invaded the Stonewall Inn (a safe place for their city's queer community). A drag queen with an eccentric personality, Marsha will forever be known as the turning point in LGBTQ activism. </p>

        <h4>Stormé DeLarverie</h4>
        <p> One of the earliest lesbian practicers of genderfluid dressing, Stormé is believed to have thrown the first punch at the Stonewall riot. <br>A singer, bodyguard, and drag king: they are known for being a key developer of gender expression by cross-dressing in masculine outfits. </p>
