        <h4>Bretman Rock</h4>
        <p> Bretman Rock Sacayanan Laforga is a gay Filipino beauty influencer, his most successful accounts being on Youtube and Instagram. One of the few men in the beauty industry, he is an Ilocano born in the Philippines but moved to Hawaii as a child, where he is now based. Known for his flamboyant personality and sense of humor, he became famous when one of his makeup contour videos went viral. Despite his social media repertoire mainly consisting of makeup tutorials and vlogs featuring his humorous life views, the influencer has also long been considered an icon of the LGBTQIA+ community. His confidence in being who he is and not hiding his sexuality for any reason serves as an inspiration, most especially to those in the community. </p>

Elected as Representative of Bataan’s 1st District in 2016, she became chairperson of the House Committee on Women and Gender Equality in 2022. Furthermore, in the 18th Congress, she was one of those termed “equality champs” who pushed for the passing of the SOGIE equality bill, which would greatly impact LGBTQIA+ rights in a predominantly Catholic country. Together with the House Speaker, she filed the Civil Partnership Bill, a House Bill that would legalize even same-sex civil unions. </p>

A drag queen with an eccentric personality, Marsha will forever be known as the turning point in LGBTQ activism. </p>
